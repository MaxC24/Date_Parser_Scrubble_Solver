How to Build the Golden Gate Bridge with Lego.

1- First I would take care of the poles. Build a large part, that would then go in the water, on land as tall enough so that when I put it in the water there would be a part coming out already, to avoid most of the work that I would have to do  underwater, where, at the same time, I am building the secured lego base that will connect to the two poles.

2 - Bring the two half built poles with helicopters and slowly lowered them and attach them to the bases.

3 - After the poles are in position. I would keep adding pieces to the poles to reach the desired height, while at the same time start building the sides on land.

4- After the poles reach the expected height I will connected the top of the poles with the sides on land with a curved rigid cable, and build the suspended part (the actual bridge) that connect the land with the poles. running other smaller cables that go vertically from the cable, that I ran earlier, to the suspended structure to support the weight. I do that until the land sides connects to the two poles with two short paths.

5- At this point I have the the two sides of the bridge. so I run two other curved rigid cables that connect the top of the two poles together and, as I did before, start building the bridge from the two poles running vertical cables to keep the structure weight, precenting it from falling in the water.

6 - I do that until I reach the center of the bridge where the two halves will eventually connect to complete the Lego Golden Gate Bridge.
